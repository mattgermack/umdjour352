        <div id="def-a-better-way-to-do-this">
            <p>Promoted after just four months in the newsroom, had just a week to learn new role. I assist in oversight of all desks, primarily sports and news, making sure content is proficient in quantity, quality and timeliness. I must be reachable on Slack at all times, and am responsible for last round of editing and publishing; requires perfect attention to detail in order to avoid clarifications or corrections of any kind. As copy editor, I worked with my copy desk coworkers to ensure factual and grammatical perfection in published work — each article taking 1-2 hours. </p>

            <p>I write either preview or game recap for each Maryland football game, also writing occasional sidebars and features. Game recaps must be posted minutes after the game; job requires excellent timeliness. I must attend all home games and live-tweet all games. Last year I covered UMD’s world-class women’s lacrosse program. I wrote the game preview and recap for all 22 games, as well as occasional sidebars, which added up to over 33,000 words over the season. In Fall of 2022, I contributed articles for volleyball and men's soccer when primary writers weren't available.</p>

            <p>I photographed families and individuals of all ages — sessions included family photos, baby photos, graduation/business portraits, birthday and holiday themed photos, graduation/business portraits and more. I was often was the only person in the studio, so was responsible for fully closing the studio and properly storing and cleaning equipment. It required excellent customer service skills, ability to clearly communicate directions, and above all else a positive attitude.</p>
