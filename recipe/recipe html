    <p>My mom didn't have a ton of money growing up, but as a nutritionist, she was always obsessed with health.</p>
    <p>This recipe was something she made religiously — an easy, nutritient-filled but inexpensive recipe that only takes 10-15 minutes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <i>Two-person serving</i>
    <ul>
        <p>4-5 leaves of kale</p>
        <p>1/6 stick of butter</p>
        <p>1 lemon</p>
        <p>Nutritional yeast</p>
        <p>Tahini</p>
        <p>Salt</p>
    </ul>
    <br></br>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
    	<p>1. Melt the butter in pan until liquid. While this is happening, tear up each kale leaf into 6-8 pieces and juice the lemon</p>
        <p>2. Place kale in pan and spatulate until kale is noticably darker and relatively soaked</p>
        <p>3. Pour lemon juice into pan and spatulate it into the kale</p>
        <p>4. Spatulate occasionally until kale is unappetizingly wrinkly and dark(but not burned)</p>
        <p>5. Add 1-2 tablespoons of nutrional yeast, based on preference. Add .5-1 tablespoons of tahini(more tahini = blander) and mix both in thoroughly</p>
        <p>6. Serve, salt to liking and enjoy!</p>
    </ol>
