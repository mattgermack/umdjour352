                        <p>San Francisco 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan is widely regarded as one of the NFL’s most innovative coaches. He hadn’t earned that title following league-wide trends.</p>
                        <p>The NFL underwent an offensive revolution in the 2010’s. The information era swept the country, and sports were no different — in football’s case, modern analytics show passing the ball is more efficient than running the ball.</p>
                        <p>Shanahan didn’t buy in, though. In 2019, he had a major problem at quarterback — Jimmy Garoppolo, whose career appears in jeopardy after just six starts outside of Shanahan’s offense. Not able to rely on his passing game, he constructed a run scheme based on giving his running backs two things — favorable boxes to run into and open space to create explosive plays.</p>
                        <p>It worked. The 49ers ran the ball more than all but one team in the league. Paired with a stifling defense, that attack turned in a 13-3 season and the 49ers made the Super Bowl.</p>
                        <p>Garoppolo threw the ball just eight times in a 37-20 demolition of the Packers in the NFC Championship game that year, the fewest pass attempts in a playoff win since 1974.</p>

            <h2>How did we get here?</h2>
            <p>Running the ball to set up the pass, an ages-old philosophy, was proven false. In turn, many modern offenses turned to their air attacks to set up explosive runs. 15 of the 16 most pass-happy seasons in NFL history have come since 2009 — there’s been 15 seasons since 2009.</p>                    </div>
