                    <p>My name is Matt Germack. I'm a hard-working, self-driven and detail-oriented student journalist at the University of Maryland.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I'm a sophomore journalism and government & politics double major with multiple semesters of both writing and editing experience. I'm currently assistant managing editor for The Diamondback, the university's flagship student newspaper, a role I started after just four months as a copy editor. I help manage a staff of over 100 students helping create a positive workplace environemnt, while providing feedback to writers to ensure everyone in the newsroom is at their best.</p>
                    <p>I cover Maryland football and women's lacrosse for Terrapin Sports Central, writing game recaps, previews, analysis and features about the teams during their respective seasons. I also take photos at various sporting events for the publication.</p>
                    <p>I'm from the Bay Area. I love the mountains, and try to get to the Sierra Nevadas as much as I can. In my free time I love to spend time with people, work out and hike.</p>
